## General info

On the basis of a medical news I did the text cleaning (clean the stop words, lematized). Then calculate the frequency of words and graph it with Matplotlib. Below I did Topic Modeling with Gensim. Then calculate the efficiency of the model with c_v measure. It is a simple code. I made it short so it wouldn't be so heavy to read. Anything let me know if you would like any modification or something to be added.
